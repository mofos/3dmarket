            <h4>an ancient Greek statue and one of the most famous works of ancient Greek sculpture. Initially it was attributed to the sculptor Praxiteles, but based on an inscription that was on its plinth, the statue is now thought to be the work of Alexandros of Antioch.[1]

              Created sometime between 130 and 100 BC, the statue is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. However, some scholars claim it is the sea-goddess Amphitrite, venerated on Milos.[2] It is a marble sculpture, slightly larger than life size at 203 cm (6 ft 8 in) high. Part of an arm and the original plinth were lost following the statue's discovery. It is currently on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The statue is named after Aphrodite's Roman name, Venus, and the Greek island of Milos, where it was discovered.</h4>
            <p>Many modern artists have been inspired by this piece since she first arrived at the Louvre. (ancient eu) One of the more notable pieces was created by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul C√©zanne who drew a pencil study in 1881. Another inspired work was by Ren√© Magritte, who painted a reduced-scale version of plaster, with bright pink and dark blue, entitled ‚ÄúLes Menottes de Cuivre‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Copper Handcuffs‚Äù in 1931. Even more recently are the works of Neo-Dada Pop artist Jim Dine, who often utilizes the Venus de Milo in his sculptures and paintings since the 1970s. But, possibly the most widely-known adaptation is that of Salvador Dal√≠, with his 1936 creation ‚ÄúVenus de Milo aux tiroirs (Venus of Milos with Drawers).‚Äù </p>
